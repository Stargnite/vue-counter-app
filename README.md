# Vue.js Counter App

This is a simple counter app built using Vue.js, a popular JavaScript framework for building a single page user interface. The app allows users to increment or decrement a counter by clicking on two buttons, and displays the current count value. There is also a reset button used to return the count value back to its original state which is '0' 
### The app:
 https://vue-counter-app-d9ce4.web.app/

### Getting Started
To get started with the app, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Once you have installed these tools, you can follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/your-username/vue-counter-app.git
2. Change into the app directory: cd vue-counter-app
3. Install the dependencies:
```
npm install
```
4. Start the app:
```
npm run serve
```
5. Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8080 to see the app in action.

### Using the App
Once you have the app up and running, you will see a simple interface when you click on the counter nav with three buttons and a counter. To increment the counter, click on the "+" button, to decrement the counter, click on the "-" button and to reset the counter, click on the "reset" button. The current count value will be displayed in the center of the app.

### Customizing the App
If you want to customize the app, you can modify the code in the src directory. The App.vue file contains the main component for the app, while the main.js file sets up the Vue.js app and mounts it to the DOM.

You can also modify the styling of the app by editing the App.vue file or adding your own CSS file.

### Conclusion

With just a few lines of code, you can create a functional app that allows users to interact with data in real time. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, Vue.js provides a powerful and flexible toolset for building web applications.
